# OpenGLPong
Pong based on OpenGL for module Computer Graphics in HSLU

During the module Computer Graphics at the Technical University of Lucerne (HSLU) a step by step instruction was given how to achieve the goal of a 3D Pong.

The course was started with drawing the necessary elements in 2D (a circle, two bars).
This will later be translated to a 3D game
